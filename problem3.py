	# Now you can put the reigns in your own hands!  Let's try playing Rock Paper Scissors.
	# This will need two things you haven't used before; input(), and random().
	# var = input("Your question? ") will allow the user to enter a value and have it saved to var.
	# var = random() will make var a random number between 0 and 1. To get a 
	# random number between 0 and 10, use var = random(0,10)
	
	# Your code goes here!
